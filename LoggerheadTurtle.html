        <p class = LHTF1>Hawksbill turtles get their name from their
          narrow pointed beak. They have a distinctive pattern on their
          shells, overlapping scales that form a serrated-look on the edges.
          Due to this, the coloured and patterned shells are highly-valuable
          and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.<br>Hawksbill
          turtles are found throughout tropical oceans, predominantly coral
          reefs. Their main food source is sponges, which they extract by
          using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on
          the reef, however they also eat sea anemones and jellyfish.</p>

        <p class = LHTF2>Hawksbill Turtles grow up to 45 inches in shell length
          and 150 pounds in weight. The carapace or upper shell is heart shaped
          whilst they are young, and as they mature it elongates.<br>Hawksbills
          migrate incredible distances in order to move from feeding sites to
          move from feeding sites to nesting grounds, normally on tropical
          beaches. Female hawksbills return to the beaches where they were born
          to nest, every two to five years. This takes place in shallow waters
          close to the shore.<p>
