        <h2>General Facts</h2>
        <!--Class is Green Turtle Fact 1-->
        <p class = GTF1>Green turtles are a large sea turtle
        that are usually between 110kg - 190kg when fully grown
        however the largest found was 395kg. They have a smooth
        wide carapace or shell and usually grow up to 3-4 feet
        long and is heart shaped, however the largest found was
        5 feet in length, which makes them the largest
        hard-shelled sea turtle.They are reptiles with the
        scientific name Chelonia mydas; Chelonia being the genus
        and mydas being the species. Despite its name a green sea
        turtle's shell is not always green, they can be a blend
        of different colours, including brown, olive, grey or black.
        The underside is a yellowish white colour with the turtles
        head having brown and yellow markings. Green turtles get
        their name from their body fat which is green.
        Unfortunately they are an endangered spieces and the current
        population trend is on the decline.

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <!--Green Turtle Fact 2-->
        <p class = GTF2>Green turtles are found throughout the world
        however they are mainly found in tropical and subtropical
        waters where they stay near the coastline and around islands.
        Some locations are: Mesoamerican Reef,  Coastal East Africa,
        Gulf of California, The Gal√°pagos, Coral Triangle living in
        bays and protected shores, especially in areas with seagrass
        beds. They have been observed clambering onto land to
        sunbathe and they are rarely found in the open ocean.

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <!--Class is Green Turtle Fact 3-->
        <p class = GTF3>Green Turtles live for a long time, up to 70
        years or more. Males mate with females on foraging grounds,
        along migratory pathways, and off nesting beaches. Female turtles
        reach maturity at 25 - 35 years old. Once matured, every 2 - 5
        years they will migrate back to the beaches where they were hatched
        decades earlier. They dig a pit into the sand with their flippers,
        dig a pit where they lay 100 - 200  eggs, covers the pit and then
        returns to sea, they will leave the eggs to hatch after about 2
        months. Once hatched they will make their way to the water. Hatchlings
        orient themselves seaward by moving away from the darkest
        silhouette of the landward dune or vegetation to crawl towards
        the brightest horizon. On underdeveloped beaches, this is
        toward the open horizon over the ocean.

        <h2>Threats</h2>
        <!--Class is Green Turtle Fact 3-->
        <p class = GTF4>
        Bycatch in fishing gear is a primary threat to green turtles, although
        unintended it can result in the turtles drowning or causing injuries
        that can lead to death or debilitation, examples are; swallowing hooks,
        or flippers getting entangeled in the nets.<br>Unfortunately green
        turtles were killed in large numbers for their fat, meat and eggs, which
        has lead to a catastrophic global decline of the species. While illegal
        in some countries, in others killing green turtles and collecting their
        eggs is still legal and this disrupts regional efforts to help the
        species recover from their endangered status.<br>The loss and degredation
        of nesting habitats due to coastal development and rising seas from
        climate change. Seawalls also known as shorline hardening or armouring
        can result in the loss of dry sand suitable for successful nesting.
        Artificial lighting on and near nesting beaches can deter females from
        coming ashore to nest and can disorient hatchlings trying to find the
        sea after emerging from their nests.

        <h2>Threats Continued</h2>
        <!--Class is Green Turtle Fact 5-->
        <p class = GTF5>
        Multiple different types of vessels can strike green turtles when they
        are near or at the surface resulting in injury or death. Unfortunately
        this is another major threat these turtles face, in particular large
        juveniles and adults near ports, waterways , and developed coastlines
        are the most at risk. High boat traffic areas such as marinas and
        inlets present a higher risk to green turtles. Nesting females are more
        susceptible to vessel strikes when making migrations to nest and whilst
        they are near shore during nesting season.<br>Increasing pollution of
        nearshore and offshore marine habitats threatens all sea turtles and
        degrades their habitats. Oil spills are some of the most damaging to
        their habitats and the turtles themselves. one of the most damaging
        being the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Ingestion of marine debris such
        as fishing lines, balloons, plastic bags, floating tar, or oil and other
        discarded materials by humans can be mistaken for food. They can also
        become entangled in lost or discarded fishing gear, which can seriously
        injure or kill them.<br>A warming climate is likely to result in changes
        in beach morphology and higher sand temperatures which can be lethal to
        eggs or altar the ratio of male to female hatchlings. Beach erosion is
        caused by rising seas and storms, which may flood nests or wash them
        away. Changes in the temerature of the marine environment is likely to
        alter the abundance and distribution of food, leading to a shift in the
        migratory and foraging and nesting seasons of green turtles.<br>
        Fibropapillomatosis is a disease that causes external and internal
        tumors. These tumors can significantly affect their ablility to swim and
        feed and can lead to death. The disease is most common in green turtles
        and some evidence has linked the disease prevalence to degraded marine
        habitats.
