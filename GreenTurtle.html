        <p class = GTF1>The green turtle is one of the
          largest sea turtles and is the only herbivore
          among the different species.<br>Green Turtles
          are named for the greenish colour of their
          cartilage and fat, not their shells, They are
          also called have black turtles by the local
          communities.</p>

        <!--Green Turtle Fact 2-->
        <p class = GTF2>Green turtles are mainly found
          in tropical and subtropical waters. They
          migrate long distances between feeding
          grounds and the beaches they were hatched.<br>
          They graze on seagrasses and algae, which
          maintains seagrass beds.<br>The seagrass green
          turtles graze upon are quickly digested which
          then becomes nutrients to many species of
          plants and animals that live in the seagrass
          system.<p>
