        <p>Jupiter is a massive threat. Literally. Jupiters gravitational pull
           is so strong that everything is slowly being pulled towards it,
           including turtles, slowly but surely we'll have no more turtles left!

        <p>The wars turtles embark upon each other is one of the fastest ways
          they are being killed, they are raised as warriors from birth and
          fight to the bitter end. It's almost at the point where they are
          killing more numbers than are being born.</p>
