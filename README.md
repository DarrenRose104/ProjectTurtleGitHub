# ProjectTurtleGitHub
 A website about turtles.

I've added the basic layout, now what I want to do is add more factual pages of the different species via a drop down menu from when the cursor is hovered over the species panel of the navigation bar.

I will need to do some research for the information displayed on the webpage, I'll have to use different sources and link them in the website, here are my sources:
